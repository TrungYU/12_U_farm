1930 Team 12 Project

U-Farm is an online platform that connects urban farmers with local consumers. On this web app, urban farmers are able to post the produce they grow up for sale. Users are then able to browse and purchase the produce from the urban farmers.

The public folder contains all the necessary html pages for the U-Farm project, which is connected to our real-time database. The css, javascript, and image files referenced in the HTML pages are all contained in their own sub-folders.
